#### Project Summary
The purpose of this project is to deliver an interesting, fun, and convenient way to spend some time in transit on mobile devices, tablets, or on the browser of a personal computer. We accomplish this by designing a compelling, strategic game with a comfortable user interface on a touch screen as well as on personal computers.
##### Project Goals
The main goals of this project are to:
Provide the user with entertainment while engaging their critical thinking abilities.
Guarantee ease of usability of the game; navigating menus, features, etc.
Create experiences that set themselves apart from the current popular mobile game skinner box dynamic.
##### Product Features
Platform: We plan to launch the game as a web app.
The Game: The game itself lies somewhere between Chess and an RPG; players choose what units to set to the field and command them against one or more other players for supremacy of the game field.
1. __Profiles and Matchmaking:__ We plan for each user to have their own profile which tracks their rank among other players based on their wins and losses. Each player must accept the Terms and Conditions of using the application in making the profile. The matchmaking engine the game uses should take each playerâ€™s rank into account.
1. __Chat Client:__ Players in a game lobby should have the ability to chat amongst themselves. The player will be able to disable the chat if they are not comfortable with it.
##### Limitations
These are ideas that we think would be nice to have but are secondary to the meat of the project.

#### Stretch Goals
These are ideas that we think would be nice to have but are secondary to the meat of the project.
* It might be interesting to include different game modes so that the player never gets bored of the same play dynamic. These game modes could be made easily by applying simple alterations to the existing game: Increasing the size of the field, the player armies, or the number of players, or by introducing specific objectives.
* Ideally we want the game to reach as many people as possible. Porting the game to both IOS and Android is a worthwhile endeavor for this goal.
