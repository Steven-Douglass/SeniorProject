#### Project Summary
The purpose of this project is to deliver an interesting, fun, and convenient way to spend some time in transit on the browser of a personal computer. We accomplish this by designing a tic-tac-toe game with a comfortable user interface on personal computers.
##### Project Goals Accomplished
The main goals of this project are to:
* Design a tic-tac-toe game that can be played by multiple remote users on different devices
* Allow users to create logins, profiles, and look up available games.
* Implement leaderboards to track site-wide statistics
##### Product Features
* __Platform
:__ Web app/Platform agnostic.
* __Game Concept:__ The game itself is a tic-tac-toe game. The Initial design will allow for 1v1 gameplay over the internet.
1. __Profiles and Open Games:__ The user can track if they're one of the top 10 players using the global leaderboards. Players play games by searching the open games on the game selection page.
##### Limitations
Server-side hosting (for user profiles, and real-time state information for each game) will make scalability a challenge.
